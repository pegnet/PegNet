Contributor License Agreement
=============================

The PegNet community wishes to encourage contributions to the software, documentation, and other
materials. We also wish to maintain the most flexibility in how the development of the
PegNet protocol is organized and managed in the future.

The purpose of this agreement is to provide to the Community clarity on the copyrights and licenses
used in the development of the PegNet

We really have no interest in managing the copyrights of work contributed.  Signing here only
attests to the contributions to the body of work.  It isn't required to contribute.  However,
adding your information, and creating a pull request with your information indicates you agree
with the following:

  * This agreement applies to all PegNet repositories, found under [github.com/pegnet]
  * You agree to adhere to the github terms of service [https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/]
  * Your work will be made available under the MIT license that governs the source for the
    PegNet.
  * Agreeing to the MIT license does mean you do agree that your work might be re-licensed under other
    licenses without restriction, including use within commercial and proprietary products.
